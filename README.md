# Udacity Movie Rental

  This project is an activity from Udacity's Data Science nanodegree. It focuses mainly on reading and treating data using SQL, from a database provided by Udacity. The goal is to identify and solve problems and display them through visualizations.
  To load the database, I used PostgreSQL and saved the filtered files in CSV format. I used the Python "matplotlib" library to generate visualization graphs from the CSV files read into Pandas dataframes. Along with the graphs, I included a brief storytelling of my proposal. 

You can access the code in the file "Project_eman.ipynb" inside the repository and the graphics/proposal in the "UMR_Project" PDF file.
Also, you can access eveything through the following Google Colab link:

# Interactive Dashboard

Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to have an interactive visualization and provide other types of data, beyond what the exercise proposed. This activity was not part of the project, I just wanted to include it.
